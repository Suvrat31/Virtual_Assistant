<h2>Methodology</h2><br>

Following Waterfall Model for this project:

<b>Planning and Requirement Gathering :</b> In this phase , we intend to gather resources, use cases and decide upon the flow of the project including key deliverables towards the end .
<br><br><b>Designing :</b> This phase includes forming a concrete opinion on team role division and technologies to be used throughout the project
<br><br><b>Coding and Implementation :</b><br>This phase includes some of the following steps-
<br>Step 1: Process user inputs. Voice Inputs will be converted to text with the help of an API e.g. Google Cloud Speech API , otherwise text inputs will be processed.
<br>Step 2: Apply NLP ( Natural Language Processing ) to the final converted text input.
<br>Step 3: Take specified action according to the text input received. 
<br>Step 4: Enable the user to define custom triggers for specific events in  a file. Events can be defined as bash commands and Triggers can be defined as the keywords that trigger the specified event through voice or text. 
<br>Step 5: Display the desired result to the terminal .
<br><br><b>Testing :</b> This phase includes the debugging process or finding boundary test cases which might cause a fatal error to the program execution.
<br><br><b>Deployment :</b> This phase includes optimizing parts of the projects if possible and then further publishing a report hence concluding the project.
